## Stock and Crypto Price Prediction with TensorFlow, LSTM, XGBRegressor, and Streamlit

The Model was trained with differents Stocks and Cryptos Prices, like Google, Amazon, Netflix, Bitcoin, Apple, Ethereum, and with the features Open Price and Volume. Also with two Machine Learning Algorithms, the first one is `LSTM` built with TensorFlow, and the second one is `XGBRegressor`, wich each Model have different approach and results.

## Check-it out
Test the differents Model by running the `app.py` file, built with `Streamlit`. The Model predicts Tommorrow Price of the Crypto or the Stock selected.

## Run
```sh
streamlit run app.py
```
